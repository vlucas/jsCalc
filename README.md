Resources Used
--------------
A list of all the resources I used during the creation of this project:

[Google Image Search for Calulator](https://www.google.com/search?site=&tbm=isch&q=calculator) because, you know... I haven't memorized the layout of calculator buttons yet
[Adobe Kuler](https://kuler.adobe.com/) for color pallette selection (and specifically based on [this theme](https://kuler.adobe.com/A-Future-Afternoon-color-theme-3736042))
[Mozilla CSS Docs on linear-gradients](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/linear-gradient) help with all the browser-compatible CSS liner-gradient rules
